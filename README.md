# ECOMMERCE-SALES-DASHBOARD
I recently developed an E-Commerce Sales Dashboard in Power BI to analyze and visualize sales data in an interactive way. The goal of this dashboard is to help businesses monitor performance, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions effectively.

🔎 Key Insights Covered:

Overall Sales Performance → Track revenue, profit, and growth trends over time.

Product & Category Analysis → Identify best-selling items and categories driving business.

Regional Sales Distribution → Understand where customers are buying most.

Customer Behavior → Insights into purchase frequency and order trends.

Time-Based Analysis → Compare sales monthly, quarterly, and yearly.

💡 This dashboard makes it easier for decision-makers to:
✔️ Spot growth opportunities
✔️ Improve sales strategies
✔️ Allocate resources effectively

📈 By transforming raw data into clear visuals, this project demonstrates how data analytics can play a vital role in optimizing e-commerce operations.
